# Message frequency rules {#frequency-rules}

[!DNL Journey Optimizer] allows you to control how often users will receive a message or enter into a journey by setting cross-channel rules that will automatically exclude over-solicited profiles from messages and actions.

For example, you don't want your brand to send more than 3 marketing messages per month to their customers.
 
To do this, you can use a frequency rule which will cap the number of messages sent based on one or more channels during a monthly calendar period.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Message frequency rules are different from opt-out management, which allows users to unsubscribe from receiving communications from a brand. [Learn more](../messages/consent.md#opt-out-management)

## Access rules {#access-rules}

Rules are available from the **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL Rules]** menu. All rules are listed, sorted by modification date.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To access, create, edit or delete message frequency rules, you must have the [Manage frequency rules](../administration/high-low-permissions.md#manage-frequency-rules) permission.

Use the filter icon to filter on the category, status, and/or channel. You can also search on the message label.

## Create a rule {#create-new-rule}

To create a new rule, follow the steps below.

1. Access the **[!UICONTROL Message frequency rules]** list, then click **[!UICONTROL Create rule]**.

    ![](assets/message-rules-create.png)

1. Define the rule name.

    ![](assets/message-rules-details.png)

1. Select the message rule category.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Currently only the **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** category is available.

1. Set the capping for your rule, meaning the maximum number of messages that can be sent to an individual user profile each month.

   ![](assets/message-rules-capping.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Frequency cap is based on a monthly calendar period. It is reset at the beginning of each month.

1. Select the channel you want to use for this rule: **[!UICONTROL Email]** or **[!UICONTROL Push notification]**.

   ![](assets/message-rules-channels.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You must select at least one channel to be able to create the rule.

1. Select several channels if you want to apply capping across all selected channels as a total count.

   For example, set capping to 15 and select both the email and push channels. If a profile has already received 10 marketing emails and 5 marketing push notifications, this profile will be excluded from the very next delivery of any marketing email or push notification.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save as draft]** to confirm the rule creation. Your message is added in the rule list, with the **[!UICONTROL Draft]** status.

   ![](assets/message-rules-created.png)

## Activate a rule {#activate-rule}

When created, a message frequency rule has the **[!UICONTROL Draft]** status and is not impacting yet any message. To enable it, click the ellipsis next to the rule and select **[!UICONTROL Activate]**.

   ![](assets/message-rules-activate.png)

Activating a rule will impact any messages it applies to on their next execution. Learn how to [apply a frequency rule to a message](#apply-frequency-rule).

>[!NOTE]
>
>You do not need to modify or republish messages or journeys for a rule to take effect.

To deactivate a message frequency rule, click the ellipsis next to the rule and select **[!UICONTROL Deactivate]**.

![](assets/message-rules-deactivate.png)
   
The rule's status will change to **[!UICONTROL Inactive]** and the rule will not apply to future message executions. Any messages currently in execution will not be affected.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Deactivating a rule does not affect or reset any counts on individual profiles.

## Apply a frequency rule to a message {#apply-frequency-rule}
 
To apply a frequency rule to a message, follow the steps below.

1. Create a message. [Learn more](../messages/get-started-content.md#create-new-message)

1. Select the category you defined for the [rule you created](#create-new-rule).

   ![](assets/message-rules-msg-properties.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Currently only the **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** category is available for message frequency rules.

1. Select the channel(s) of your choice for your message.

   ![](assets/message-rules-msg-channels.png)

1. You can click the **[!UICONTROL Frequency rule]** link to view the frequency rules that will apply for the selected category and channel(s).

   ![](assets/message-rules-msg-link.png)

   A new tab will open to display the matching message frequency rules.

1. [Design](../design/design-emails.md) and [publish](../messages/publish-manage-message.md) your message.

All the frequency rules matching the selected category and channel(s) will be automatically applied to this message.

<!--Clicking the link out button next to the category selector will jump you over to the rules inventory screen to see which rules will be applied to the message.-->

You can view the number of profiles excluded from delivery in the [Live and Global views](../reports/message-monitoring.md), and in the [email Live report](../reports/email-live-report.md), where frequency rules will be listed as a possible reason for users excluded from delivery.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Several rules can apply to the same channel, but once the lower cap is reached, the profile will be excluded from the next deliveries.

## Example: combine several rules {#frequency-rule-example}

You can combine several message frequency rules, such as described in the example below.

1. [Create a rule](#create-new-rule) called *Overall Marketing Capping*:

   * Select all channels (Email, Push).
   * Set capping to 12.

   ![](assets/message-rules-ex-overall-cap.png)

1. To further restrict the number of marketing-based push notifications that a user is sent, create a second rule called *Push Marketing Cap*:

   * Select Push channel.
   * Set capping to 4.

   ![](assets/message-rules-ex-push-cap.png)

1. Save and [activate](#activate-rule) the rule.

1. Create a message. [Learn more](../messages/get-started-content.md#create-new-message)

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** category.

   ![](assets/message-rules-ex-category-maktg.png)

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Email]** and **[!UICONTROL Push Notification]** channels.

   ![](assets/message-rules-ex-channels.png)

1. You can click the **[!UICONTROL Frequency rule]** link to view the frequency rules that will apply for the selected category and channel(s).

1. [Design](../design/design-emails.md) and [publish](../messages/publish-manage-message.md) your message.

In this scenario, an individual profile:
* can receive up to 12 marketing messages per month;
* but will be excluded from marketing push notifications after they have received 4 push notifications.
